# Find the square root of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the square root of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Assign number_iters = 100 in the function to perform 100 iteratios.
3. Set i = 0.
4. Calculate  number = 0.5 * (number + a / number) for 100 iterations.
5. Return number

*/
def newton_method(n,n_iters = 100):
    a = float(n)
    for i in range(n_iters):
         n = 0.5 * (n + a/n)
    return n
a = int(input())
print("Square root of the number:",newton_method(a))
```
